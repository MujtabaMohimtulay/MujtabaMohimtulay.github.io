## Jekyll ##
>To generate static pages we have use Jekyll.It helps to create a basic format/template for all webpages.

>The webpages we then want to create can be given the default layout by using the *Front-matter*.
>Content can be added to default page by using liquid tags in the *default.html* page.
>The '_ config.yml' tells jeykyll some basics about the pages.
## Blogs ##

>The *blog* directory stores the *index.html* page that contains the posts.
